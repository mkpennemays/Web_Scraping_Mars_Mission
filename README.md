# Web_Scraping_Mars_Mission

In this exercise we pull a variety of data about Mars from multiple web sources and present them on a new webpage.

We used multiple tools during this exercise:
- BeautifulSoup for for parsing HTML and XML documents 
- Splinter for automate browser actions, such as visiting URLs and interacting with their items
- Pandas for data structuring
- MongoDb for saving the variety of data
- flask framework for create links from one page to another
- Bootstrap for ease in designing the page

The activity was an interesting introduction to data collection from the web. Re-presenting the data on a web page was a less interesting component of this project.
